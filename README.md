PingPong
==

Just a hackathon project.

BUILD
--

```
npm install
bower install
```

WebRTC
--
Beacause MOST OF web browser doesn't support create `WebSocketServer`, so we have to move to WebRTC.

But one good message is, we do not have to list ips.

Configureation
--

* Backend: edit `config.js`
* Frontend: you can access /config.js and get the config file. you can edit the content in pages/main/views.js


Start Server
---
Just run `npm start`
